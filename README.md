GlowUp is a beauty and skincare startup that recently ran multiple online and offline marketing campaigns. The company spent a significant budget on social media ads, influencer collaborations, and local events. Management wants to understand which campaigns delivered the best return on investment (ROI) and how to allocate marketing budget.
# 📌 Conclusion

The analysis of the Glow UP Marketing Campaign (FY 2024–25) highlights that marketing performance varies significantly across channels and campaigns, making data-driven decision-making essential.

## 🚀 Social Media emerged as the strongest performing channel, delivering the highest ROI of 86.59% with the lowest CPA of ₹891.01, making it the most cost-efficient source of conversions.
## 🔍 Search Ads generated the highest number of conversions (629) with a strong ROI of 75.51%, reinforcing its role as a reliable and scalable growth channel.

## 📈 From a campaign perspective, Product Launch (394 conversions), Referral Drive (316 conversions), and Retargeting (297 conversions) consistently outperformed other campaigns. These campaigns demonstrate strong audience alignment and should be treated as core growth drivers in future marketing plans.

## ⚠️ Email marketing, despite generating the highest number of leads (2,345), delivered the lowest ROI (58.42%) and the highest CPA (₹1,092.11). This indicates inefficiencies in lead quality, targeting, or follow-up strategies, highlighting the need for optimization rather than increased spending.

## 🎯 Overall Recommendation:
Future performance can be significantly improved by:

* Reallocating budgets toward high-ROI channels (Social Media & Search Ads)

* Optimizing underperforming channels before scaling

* Strengthening retargeting strategies

## Focusing on proven, high-converting campaign types

By adopting a data-driven budget allocation strategy and prioritizing conversion efficiency over increased spend, Glow UP can maximize ROI, reduce acquisition costs, and achieve sustainable growth in the upcoming quarters.
